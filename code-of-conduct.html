                <h2 class="major">Code of Conduct</h2>
                <p>All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our meetup are required to agree with the
                    following
                    code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from
                    all
                    participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.</p>

                <h3>The Quick Version</h3>
                <p>Our meetup is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender,
                    gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size,
                    race,
                    ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of
                    meetup
                    participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any meetup venue,
                    including
                    talks, networking, social events, Twitter and other online media. Meetup participants violating
                    these
                    rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the meetup at the discretion of the meetup organisers.</p>

                <h3>The Less Quick Version</h3>
                <h4>Purpose</h4>

                <p>A primary goal of LuxembourgJS is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the
                    most
                    varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and
                    welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity,
                    socioeconomic
                    status, and religion (or lack thereof).
                    This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as
                    well as
                    the consequences for unacceptable behavior. We will also apply those rules for the selection of
                    speakers,
                    sponsors, and venues.
                    We invite all those who participate in LuxembourgJS to help us create a safe and positive experience
                    for
                    everyone.</p>

                <h4>Unacceptable behavior</h4>
                <p>The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Discriminatory jokes and language related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual
                        orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack
                        thereof), or
                        technology choices.
                    </li>
                    <li>Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.</li>
                    <li>Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.</li>
                    <li>Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information ("doxing").
                    </li>
                    <li>Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or
                        disability.
                    </li>
                    <li>Inappropriate photography or recording.</li>
                    <li>Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone’s consent before touching them.</li>
                    <li>Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes; inappropriate touching,
                        groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances. Our meetups are not dating events.
                    </li>
                    <li>Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).</li>
                    <li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.</li>
                    <li>Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior</h4>
                <p>Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making
                    authority, will not be tolerated.
                    Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.
                    If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the meetup organisers may take any action they deem
                    appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without
                    warning.</p>

                <h4>Reporting an incident</h4>
                <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns,
                    please
                    contact one of the meetup organisers immediately. </p>

                <p>
                    The organisation team will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law
                    enforcement,
                    provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe during the
                    meetups. </p>

                <h4>Addressing Grievances</h4>
                <p>If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should

                    concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our
                    existing
                    governing policies.</p>
                <h4>Scope</h4>
                <p>We expect all participants (attendees; sponsors; speakers; hosts; and other guests) to abide by this
                    Code
                    of Conduct in all community venues–online and in-person–as well as in all one-on-one communications
                    pertaining to community business.
                    This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring
                    outside
                    the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the
                    safety and
                    well-being of community members.</p>
