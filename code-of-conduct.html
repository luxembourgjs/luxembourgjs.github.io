              <h2 class="major">Code of Conduct</h2>
              <p>
                All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our meetup are
                required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers
                will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation
                from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for
                everybody.
              </p>

              <h3>The Quick Version</h3>
              <p>
                Our meetup is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience
                for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and
                expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical
                appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack
                thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of
                meetup participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is
                not appropriate for any meetup venue, including talks, networking,
                social events, Twitter and other online media. Meetup participants
                violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the
                meetup at the discretion of the meetup organisers.
              </p>

              <h3>The Less Quick Version</h3>
              <h4>Purpose</h4>

              <p>
                A primary goal of LuxembourgJS is to be inclusive to the largest
                number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse
                backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a
                friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of
                gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic
                status, and religion (or lack thereof). This code of conduct
                outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our
                community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.
                We will also apply those rules for the selection of speakers,
                sponsors, and venues. We invite all those who participate in
                LuxembourgJS to help us create a safe and positive experience for
                everyone.
              </p>

                  lack thereof), or technology choices.

              <p>
                Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including
                sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be
                tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected
                to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing
                behavior, the meetup organisers may take any action they deem
                appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent
                expulsion from the community without warning.
              </p>

                harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact one of the

              <h4>Addressing Grievances</h4>
              <p>
                If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating
                this Code of Conduct, you should notify
                <a
                  href="https://www.meetup.com/luxembourgjs/members/?op=leaders"
                  target="_blank"
                  rel="noopener noreferrer"
                  aria-label="Contact the organisation team"
                  >the organisation team</a
                >
                with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will
                be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies.
              </p>
              <h4>Scope</h4>
              <p>
                We expect all participants (attendees; sponsors; speakers; hosts;
                and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all
                community venues–online and in-person–as well as in all one-on-one
                communications pertaining to community business. This code of
                conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable
                behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when
                such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and
                well-being of community members.
